/// Parses the archive's search field into an FTS5 MATCH expression.
///
/// The library's search text used to be a single whitespace-split +
/// AND'd token list, which meant phrase search, field prefixes, and
/// negation silently didn't work — typing `title:"イラスト"` or
/// `"マディニ 画像"` just searched for those strings verbatim (colons,
/// quotes, and all). This parser turns the text into a small AST and
/// then emits syntactically-valid FTS5, so the UI can honour what the
/// user actually asked for.
///
/// ## Supported grammar
///
/// ```
/// query    := clause*
/// clause   := '-'? (field ':')? term '*'?
/// field    := 'title' | 'content'
/// term     := '"' … '"'          (phrase)
///           | non-whitespace+    (word)
/// ```
///
/// - **Bare term** (`イラスト`) — matches both `title` and `content`.
/// - **Quoted phrase** (`"マディニちゃん 描いて"`) — treated as a single
///   FTS5 phrase; the whitespace inside is preserved as token adjacency.
/// - **Field query** (`title:イラスト`, `title:"長いタイトル"`) —
///   restricts to one of the two FTS5 columns. Unknown fields
///   (e.g. `foo:bar`) are treated as a single bare token rather than
///   rejected, because FTS5 would otherwise `no such column` on them.
/// - **Negation** (`-イラスト`, `-title:foo`, `-"phrase"`) — emitted as
///   `NOT term`. FTS5 doesn't accept pure-negation queries; the parser
///   detects that case and drops the search expression entirely so the
///   caller can fall back to "no full-text filter" instead of throwing.
/// - **Prefix** (`foo*`, `title:foo*`, `"hello world"*`) — trailing
///   `*` on a word or phrase becomes FTS5's prefix operator. With the
///   `trigram` tokenizer in use for `search_idx`, the common Japanese
///   "substring" case is already handled by the tokenizer itself; the
///   prefix operator is most useful for English tokens where you want
///   `user*` to match `user`, `users`, `username` but not `reuse`.
///   A lone `*` (or `-*`) is noise and gets dropped. `*` in the
///   middle of a word (`foo*bar`) is preserved verbatim.
/// - **Implicit AND**: multiple clauses are joined with ` AND `.
///
/// ## Out of scope (intentionally)
///
/// - Explicit `OR` / grouping. The AST is shaped to make adding them
///   later non-invasive, but they're not part of this spec because the
///   user's reported complaint was the core three — phrase, field,
///   negation — and shipping those well beats shipping everything badly.
/// - `#tag` tokens: the sidebar search bar promotes these into
///   `ArchiveSearchFilter.bookmarkTags` before calling the parser, so
///   they never reach this code. If one slips through by accident
///   (e.g. a `#` embedded mid-sentence), we treat it as a normal term.
///
/// ## FTS5 quoting
///
/// Every emitted term is double-quoted. Embedded quotes are doubled
/// (`"` → `""`) per SQLite FTS5 rules. The tokenizer (`unicode61`) then
/// tokenises the phrase contents, which gives us the same behaviour as
/// the user typing those tokens adjacently.
