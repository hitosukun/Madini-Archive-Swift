///   3. `ReaderHeaderActivityPill` — the combined title + prompt-outline
///      capsule. Shown in `.default` / `.viewer` / `.hidden`; hidden in
///      `.table` (nothing to read from).
///   4. `WorkspaceFloatingExportButton` (share) — always visible
///   5. `MiddlePaneModePicker` — always trailing, fixed size
///
/// **Pane responsibilities (see `project_three_pane_architecture`).**
/// Sort menu and date range picker control the *middle-pane content*,
/// so they live in the left sidebar (under the search field) — NOT in
/// this bar. Active filter chips also live in the sidebar (inside the
/// expanded search area). The source-origin pill and tag editor are
/// per-conversation reader concerns and live in the right pane's
/// `ConversationHeaderView`. This top bar is reserved for the activity
/// pill, share, and segment picker — Finder-/Safari-style window
/// chrome that we may extend with navigation affordances later.
